# what are you doing? (wayd)

Couldn't find a program to do what I wanted, so I built my own. Currently very hacky.

wayd is a python script that pops up every 15 minutes to ask what you're doing with a text input box. Fill in your current activity and it creates/appends a file named with today's date with the current time and your activity.

Currently, you have to keep the terminal window open the whole time it's running and it asks you where you want to store your files every time you start the script. I'm sure there's a lot of other issues I'm not aware of.

## dependencies
* PySimpleGUI
* datetime
* schedule

## to use
* download `wayd.py`
* download dependencies with `pip3 install PySimpleGUI datetime schedule`
* navigate to `wayd.py` in your terminal
* run with `python3 wayd.py &` (the `&` allows you to keep using the terminal after starting the script)
* select the folder for wayd to store your files
* wayd will ask what you're doing
    * this repeats every 15 minutes until you close the program either with `âŒƒ + c` or closing the terminal window


## future
* [ ] add ability to save settings (folder path)
* [ ] get rid of warning about NSSavePanel/NSApplication
* [ ] package as standalone app
* [ ] make GUI prettier
